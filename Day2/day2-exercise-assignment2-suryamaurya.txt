									Assignment 2:
Recursive Function and Efficiency Analysis - Write a recursive function pseudocode and calculate the nth Fibonacci number and use Big O notation to analyze its efficiency. Compare this with an iterative approach and discuss the pros and cons in terms of space and time complexity.

For Recursive approach
start
function fibo(num)
if(num <=1)
	print "num"
return fibo(num-1)+fibo(num-2)
end 
Time Complexity: O(2^n)
Space Complexity: O(n)
--------------------------------------

For Iterative approach
start
declare a=0,b=1,c=0
if 
for i in range 2 to n 
	c = a+b
	a = b
	b = c 
end for loop 
print "c"

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
