									Assignment 3:
Function Design and Modularization - Create a document that describes the design of two modular functions: one that returns the factorial of a number, and another that calculates the nth Fibonacci number. Include pseudocode and a brief explanation of how modularity in programming helps with code reuse and organization.

start
declare a vaiable num 
call function name print(fact(num))
end

start 
function fact(int num)
declare fact = 1,i 
for i in range of 1 to num
	fact *= i
end for loop
return fact
end

start 
function fibo(int num)
declare a = 0, b = 1, c = 0
if num == 1:
	return a
else if num == 2:
	return b
else if num > 2:
	for i in range of 1 to num 
		c = a+b 
		a = b 
		b = c 
end for loop 
return c
end
